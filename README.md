## terraform-aws-demo

I have a couple of older vagrant centos7 training projects
* [vagrant-c7-terraform-docker](https://github.com/dgapitts/vagrant-c7-terraform-docker) following hashicorp training, a nice set of basic exercises 
* [vagrant-c7-aws-terraform-ansible](https://github.com/dgapitts/vagrant-c7-aws-terraform-ansible) which I was using for DevOpsDays Amsterdam training

I'm still working through the hashicorp training, but switching back to developing directly on my laptop, using the manual install of terraform (i.e. download binary and add to PATH)
